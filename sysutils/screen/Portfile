description         Screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation
long_description    Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical \
                    terminal between several processes (typically interactive shells). \
                    Each virtual terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal \
                    and, in addition, several control functions from the ANSI X3.64 (ISO \
                    6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for \
                    multiple character sets). There is a scrollback history buffer for each \
                    virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text \
                    regions between windows.

# screen.git contains src dir for building though, if we set worksrcdir as src, ports will clone everything inside src dir.
# That's really meaningless and I think there is no option to select where we are configure and make inside the repository instead of the root of it.
# This extract phase move everything inside src dir into root dir of src tree so that we can configure and build.
